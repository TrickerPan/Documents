# Authors's Note

Since creating the Laravel framework, I have received numerous request for a book containing guidance on building well-architected, complex applications. As each application is unique, such a book requires that the counsel remains general, yet practical and easily applicable to a variety of projects.

So, we will begin by covering the foundational elements of dependency injection, then take an in-depth look at service providers and application structure, as well as an overview of the SOLID design principles. A strong knowledge of these topics will give you a firm foundation for all of your Laravel projects.

If you have any further questions about advanced architecture on Laravel, or wish to see something added to the book, please e-mail me. I plan to expand the book further based on community feedback, so your ideas matter!

Finally, thank you so much for being a part of the Laravel community. You have all helped make PHP development more enjoyable and exciting for thousands of people around the world. Code happy!
